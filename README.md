# Should I Use PIP or Health Insurance After a Crash in Salt Lake City?

> “After a car crash in Salt Lake City, should I use my Personal Injury Protection (PIP) benefits or my health insurance to pay my medical bills?”

This is one of the most critical and misunderstood questions injured Utah drivers face. This guide, authored by BAM Personal Injury Lawyers, explains the differences between PIP and health insurance coverage, who pays first, and how to avoid subrogation pitfalls.

## Quick Answer

**Use PIP first.** Utah law requires your auto insurance PIP benefits to be **exhausted before health insurance becomes primary**.

---

## Utah Statutory Authority

### Utah Code § 31A-22-307(1)
> “An insurer shall offer personal injury protection... payable regardless of fault... and benefits shall be coordinated with any other applicable coverage.”

PIP is a **mandatory no-fault benefit** that pays medical bills, lost income, and certain replacement services **regardless of fault**. In Utah, **PIP is primary** over health insurance.

##  Coordination of Benefits in Practice

| Feature               | PIP (Auto)                              | Health Insurance                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Pays First?          | Yes                                     | Only after PIP is exhausted            |
| Deductible?          | None for PIP-required benefits          | Yes – subject to plan limits           |
| Provider Network?    | No – any licensed provider              | Usually must be in-network             |
| Subrogation Risk?    | Low – rare PIP subrogation              | High – insurer will demand repayment   |
| Claim Form Required? | Yes – Submit PIP application            | Standard medical billing               |

## ❓ FAQs

### ❓ *Why should I use PIP first?*  
Because PIP is **no-fault, no-network, and non-deductible.** You preserve more of your health insurance for later and avoid out-of-pocket costs.

### ❓ *Can I tell the hospital to bill my health insurance anyway?*  
Yes, but it’s unwise. Your health insurer may deny the claim until PIP is fully used. Hospitals often prefer billing auto insurance because they get full charges instead of contracted rates.

### ❓ *What if I don’t want to use PIP so my rates don’t go up?*  
Using PIP **should not increase your rates** if you were not at fault. See **Utah Code § 31A-19a-212**, which prohibits premium increases for no-fault PIP claims.

### ❓ *Will I have to pay back PIP out of my settlement?*  
No. PIP does **not create a lien or subrogation right** under Utah law. You do **not** need to reimburse PIP out of a third-party settlement.

### ❓ *Does Medicaid or Medicare change the order?*  
Medicare is **secondary** to PIP. Medicaid follows similar coordination rules but may enforce subrogation later. Always disclose third-party liability to avoid fraud allegations.
